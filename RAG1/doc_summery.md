This e-book, published by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) Southern India
Regional Council, serves as a comprehensive guide to **Corporate Governance (CG) in India**.
**Concise Summary:**
The e-book defines Corporate Governance as a framework of internal controls,
policies, and procedures crucial for ensuring **transparency, integrity, ethics, and honesty** in a
company's operations and its dealings with various stakeholders. It traces the **evolution of CG in
India** from 1998, highlighting the roles of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), SEBI, and
various committees (e.g., Kumaramangalam Birla, Naresh Chandra, N.R. Narayana Murthy) in shaping its
regulations, primarily the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015. The document elaborates on fundamental **principles of good
governance**, including the OECD Principles, the "4 Pillars" (Vision & Mission, Stakeholder
Engagement, Compliance & Management, Professional Development), and the "4 P's" (People, Purpose,
Process, Performance). It details the **corporate governance structure**, emphasizing the fiduciary
role of the Board of Directors and the importance of stakeholder engagement and IT governance.
Furthermore, the e-book covers significant modern developments such as **Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) reporting**, specifically the mandatory **Business Responsibility and
Sustainability Report (BRSR)** based on the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct
(NGRBC). It also introduces **Corporate Governance Scorecards** for assessment and **Climate-Related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**, reflecting a global shift towards responsible and sustainable
business practices, while also acknowledging historical corporate governance failures in India as
cautionary lessons.
