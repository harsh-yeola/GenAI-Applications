The e-book "Corporate Governance in India" defines Corporate
Governance as a framework of internal controls, policies, and procedures designed to ensure
transparency, integrity, ethics, and honesty in a company's operations and dealings with
stakeholders. It details the evolution of CG in India, largely driven by the Ministry of Corporate
Affairs (MCA) and SEBI, through various committees (e.g., Kumaramangalam Birla, Naresh Chandra, N.R.
Narayana Murthy) and legislative acts like the Companies Act. Key concepts include the OECD
Principles of Corporate Governance, the "4 Pillars" (Vision & Mission, Stakeholder Engagement,
Compliance & Management, Professional Development & Succession), and the "4 P's" (People, Purpose,
Process, Performance). The book emphasizes core CG principles such as transparency, accountability,

fiduciary capacity. It also highlights the growing importance of Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) reporting, the transition to the mandatory Business Responsibility and
Sustainability Report (BRSR) for listed entities, and the development of Corporate Governance
Scorecards. Finally, it addresses climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD) and acknowledges
historical instances of corporate governance failures in India.
